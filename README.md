# E. Insights

#### Some of the key insights:

- Daily returns fluctuate around 0, indicating that on most days the stock doesn’t move drastically. Also, we observe several volatility spikes during certain periods, indicating days of strong market reactions or major company announcements. Compared to 2020–2022 (COVID-19, energy crises and more), the 2025 period appears relatively stable, with fewer sharp daily fluctuations.
- The cumulative return shows overall growth of the investment over 5 years.
- Rolling volatility identifies periods of increased risk, during which the market typically demands higher risk premiums and there is greater uncertainty in investor sentiment. During 2020–2021, we observe significantly higher volatility, as the market during the COVID-19 period was characterized by uncertainty rather than just increased risk.
